## 🎯 ENHANCED GUIDANCE COMPONENTS ANALYSIS

### 🔥 GROQ ENHANCEMENTS

#### **Easy/1 - Parentheses Grouping**
```
🚨 CRITICAL ALGORITHM GUIDANCE: DO NOT use regex for nested parentheses
- Algorithm: Use stack-based approach with balance counter
- Implementation: Track '(' as +1, ')' as -1, when balance=0 you have complete group
- Comparison: WRONG: re.findall() ❌ | CORRECT: Balance counter ✅
- Example: Detailed character-by-character processing example
```

#### **Easy/4 - Mean Absolute Deviation**
```
🚨 CRITICAL FORMULA GUIDANCE: Mean Absolute Deviation = MEAN, NOT median
- Algorithm: Formula: MAD = mean(|x - mean|) for all x in dataset
- Implementation: 1. Calculate mean 2. Calculate |x - mean| 3. Calculate MEAN of deviations
- Comparison: WRONG: statistics.median() ❌ | CORRECT: statistics.mean() ✅
- Example: Concrete example with [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
```

#### **Easy/9 - Make Palindrome**
```
🚨 CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE: Implement BOTH functions
- Algorithm: Main function is make_palindrome, is_palindrome is helper
- Implementation: 1. Check palindrome 2. Find palindromic suffix 3. Prepend reversed prefix
- Comparison: WRONG: Only is_palindrome ❌ | CORRECT: Both functions ✅
- Example: Detailed walkthrough for 'xyz' and 'jerry'
```

### 💎 GEMINI ENHANCEMENTS

#### **APPS/0 - Bounded Knapsack**
```
🚨 CRITICAL ALGORITHM GUIDANCE FOR KNAPSACK: Bounded knapsack problem
- Algorithm: Use dynamic programming with 2D state: dp[item_type][capacity]
- Implementation: 7-step detailed DP algorithm with reverse capacity iteration
- Requirements: MUST return dp[W] at the end, not leave incomplete
- Example: Concrete example with items=[(2,3), (3,4)], W=10, k=2
- Emphasis: COMPLETE THE IMPLEMENTATION - DO NOT LEAVE HANGING COMMENTS
```

#### **APPS/1 - Shortest Path with Obstacles**
```
🚨 CRITICAL ALGORITHM GUIDANCE: BFS with STATE tracking
- Algorithm: State: (row, col, obstacles_removed) with 3D visited array
- Implementation: 7-step BFS implementation with obstacle removal logic
- Imports: CRITICAL IMPORTS NEEDED: from collections import deque
- State: visited = set() to track (row, col, obstacles_removed)
- Returns: Return steps when reaching end, -1 if impossible
```
