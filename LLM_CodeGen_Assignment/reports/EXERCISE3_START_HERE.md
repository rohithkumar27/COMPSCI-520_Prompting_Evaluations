# 🚀 EXERCISE 3: START HERE

## Welcome!

You're about to complete Exercise 3: Specification-Guided Test Improvement.

**Deadline:** November 25, 11:59 PM EST

---

## 📖 Read This First (5 minutes)

### What is Exercise 3?

You'll use an LLM to generate formal specifications from problem descriptions, then:
1. Evaluate if the specifications are correct
2. Fix any incorrect ones
3. Use them to generate test cases
4. Compare coverage with Exercise 2

### Why are we doing this?

To explore how formal specifications can guide test generation and whether they improve coverage compared to coverage-driven testing (Exercise 2).

## 🚨 Important Notes

### ✅ Do This:
- Use the exact prompts provided
- Document raw LLM output (don't modify it)
- Evaluate each assertion carefully
- Explain your reasoning
- Provide case-specific insights

### ❌ Don't Do This:
- Modify the prompts
- Skip the evaluation step
- Accept all LLM output as correct
- Give generic explanations
- Wait until the last minute

---

## 💡 Key Insight

**It's okay if coverage doesn't improve!**

The goal is to explore the relationship between specifications and testing. If coverage doesn't improve, just explain why (e.g., "specs target same edge cases as Exercise 2"). You'll still get full credit.
