    """
    Solves the knapsack variant problem with item type limit using dynamic programming
    with binary splitting for improved efficiency.

    You are given N item types, each with a weight w[i] and value v[i].
    You have a knapsack with capacity W.
    You can take at most K items of each type.

    Find the maximum value you can achieve.

    Parameters:
    - n: number of item types (Note: len(items) is used internally for robustness)
    - w: knapsack capacity
    - k: max items per type
    - items: list of (weight, value) tuples

    Returns:
    - The maximum value achievable.
