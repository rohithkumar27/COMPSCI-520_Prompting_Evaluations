def shortest_path_with_obstacles(grid: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
    '''
    You are given a grid of size N x M where:
    - 0 represents an empty cell
    - 1 represents an obstacle
    - 2 represents the start position
    - 3 represents the end position
    
    You can move in 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
    However, you have a special ability: you can remove at most K obstacles during your journey.
    
    Find the shortest path from start to end, considering you can remove at most K obstacles.
    Return the minimum number of steps, or -1 if impossible.
    
    Parameters:
    - grid: 2D list representing the grid
    - k: maximum number of obstacles you can remove
    
    Example:
    grid = [[2, 1, 0, 0],
            [0, 1, 1, 0], 
            [0, 0, 1, 3]]
    k = 1
    
    Without removing obstacles: impossible
    With removing 1 obstacle: can reach in 5 steps
