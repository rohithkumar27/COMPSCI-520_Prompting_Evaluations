def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)

    (10, 24)
    """
    # 1. UNDERSTAND: The goal is to calculate the sum and product of elements in a list of integers.
    #    Special cases for empty lists are defined: sum is 0, product is 1.

    # 2. ANALYZE EXAMPLES:
    #    - `sum_product([])` should return `(0, 1)`. This confirms the base cases for an empty list.
    #    - `sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])` should return `(10, 24)`.
    #      - Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
    #      - Product: 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24

    # 3. IDENTIFY PATTERNS:
    #    - Summation: This is a standard cumulative operation.
    #    - Product: This is also a standard cumulative operation.
    #    - Iteration: We need to go through each element of the list.

    # 4. CONSIDER EDGE CASES:
    #    - Empty list: Handled by the problem statement (sum=0, product=1).
    #    - List with one element: The sum will be that element, and the product will be that element.
    #    - List with zeros: The product will become 0 if any element is 0.
    #    - List with negative numbers: Standard arithmetic applies.

    # 5. PLAN ALGORITHM:
    #    - Initialize `current_sum` to 0.
    #    - Initialize `current_product` to 1.
    #    - Iterate through each `number` in the input `numbers` list.
    #    - In each iteration:
    #        - Add `number` to `current_sum`.
    #        - Multiply `current_product` by `number`.
    #    - After the loop, return a tuple `(current_sum, current_product)`.

    # 6. IMPLEMENT:

    current_sum = 0
    current_product = 1

    for number in numbers:
        current_sum += number
        current_product *= number

    return (current_sum, current_product)
